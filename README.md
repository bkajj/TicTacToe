# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe game made in C++ with SFML. It was my first SFML project, I followed Sonar Systems Tic Tac Toe tutorial and added some of my stuff such as minmax AI, sounds, music and some other features that I don't remember. 

## How to run it

Since it is made using SFML so you need to install it first. It works on windows, haven't tested it on linux yet.

### Installing SFML

- Download SFML from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- Unzip it
- Configure your project dependencies like [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php)
